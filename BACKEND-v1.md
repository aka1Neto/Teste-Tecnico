# Programming Challenge

Congratulations on being selected to participate in our technical test. It consists of a programming challenge and it will address different skills. Read the instructions carefully and we wish you the best of luck.

## Notes

Upload all your deliverables to your repository. We will use it to evaluate your test. Once you are done, please share your repository with us.

## Introduction

We want you to develop a project that makes uses of a [movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies). It consists of two goals and the details on each one of them is given below.

## Preparing the Dataset

The first goal of this challenge is to process and prepare the dataset for usage.

In order to do so, you must download the dataset, process it, model your database schema, and save it accordingly.

## Consuming the Data

The second goal of this challenge is to create an API to consume the database you have processed.

For this part, you are free to choose whatever endpoints you think are necessary.

Please remember to document your solution well so that we know what technical decisions you took during the implementation.

## Deliverables

You must provide the following artifacts:
- The source-code of the programs that you implemented;
- A set of instructions on how to prepare the environment, build the programs, run your application, and how to use your project;
- Comments on what technologies and patterns you used and the reasons to do so, as well as the decisions you made throughout the challenge;
- Any other artifact you find relevant for your overall evaluation.

## Tips

- Make sure your instructions are easy to follow and that each step works as expected;
- Testing is more than welcome;
- Show us everything you know about best practices in Git;
- Think carefully about your code quality, in terms of maintainability, readability, and simplicity;
- Do not overengineer your solution.
